## Introduction ##

TSTool is a powerful software tool that automates time series processing and product generation.
It was originally developed for the State of Colorado to process data for basin modeling and has since
been enhanced to work with many data sources including:

*   United States Geological Survey (USGS) web service and file formats
*   Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) web services
*   Regional Climate Center (RCC) Applied Climate Information Service (ACIS) web services
*   US Army Corps of Engineers DSS data files
*   others

TSTool is maintained by the Open Water Foundation,
which also enhances the software based on project needs.

## TSTool use with Amazon Web Services ##

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a platform that supports organizations by providing cloud resources for data management and processing.
See the following resources:

*   [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)

If you are reading this documentation, you are already using AWS or have an interest in doing so.
Discuss AWS with your organization's information technology group or contact OWF.
If you are not using AWS but are using Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, or another cloud platform,
contact OWF to discuss TSTool integration with those platforms.

TSTool can be used with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to automate publishing information products to AWS,
for example to share analysis results within an organization or the public.
This plugin streamlines the use of AWS within a TSTool workflow (command file).
Consequently, the TSTool software can do the work that previously was done manually using the AWS Console or command line tools.
