## Introduction ##

TSTool is a powerful software tool that automates time series processing and product generation.
It was originally developed for the State of Colorado to process data for basin modeling and has since
been enhanced to work with many data sources including:

*   United States Geological Survey (USGS) web service and file formats
*   Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) web services
*   Regional Climate Center (RCC) Applied Climate Information Service (ACIS) web services
*   US Army Corps of Engineers DSS data files
*   others

TSTool is maintained by the Open Water Foundation,
which also enhances the software based on project needs.

*   See the latest [TSTool Documentation](https://opencdss.state.co.us/tstool/latest/doc-user/) to learn about core TSTool features.
*   See the [TSTool Download website](https://opencdss.state.co.us/tstool/) for the most recent software versions and documentation.

## TSTool use with Google Drive ##

Google Drive for storing data files in the cloud.
See the following resources:

*   [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

If you are reading this documentation, you are already using Google Drive or have an interest in doing so.
Discuss Google Drive with your organization's information technology group or contact OWF.
If you are not using Google Drive but are using Google Cloud Platform (GCP),
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or another cloud platform,
contact OWF to discuss TSTool integration with those platforms.

Google Drive is not the same as Google Cloud Platform Storage.
Google Drive is consumer grade storage whereas GCP is cloud infrastructure.
Google Drive is a component of [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/),
which can be used to support an organization's business operations.
Installing Google Drive software on a Windows computer will integrate Google Drive
with File Explorer, for example using the `G:` drive to access Google Drive files.

TSTool can be used with Google Drive to automate publishing information products to Google Drive,
for example to share analysis results within an organization or the public.
This plugin streamlines the use of Google Drive within a TSTool workflow (command file).
Consequently, the TSTool software can do the work that previously was done manually using the Google Drive web page or other software.

The TSTool Google Drive plugin can also be used on Linux,
which does not support Google Drive desktop software.
